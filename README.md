# HexGame

# This is my version of the HexGame which uses Minimum Spanning Trees, my own custom templates for Nodes and Graphs as well as a small game AI using Diskstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.
# The goal of the project was to make the AI calculations more efficient and quicker to respond and play. Therefore, I had to make the game playable in reasonable amount of time while having the best AI opponent. Using Templates in C++, optimized Nodes and Graphs specific for the game rules, I was able to make the game reasonably playable (less then 2 seconds to wait for AI to make choice) for a 15x15 tiles HexGame out-performing the accepted 11x11 tournament game.
